A modern and as minimalistic as possible web application for keeping records of all kinds, using Markdown to format these records in a convenient format. It is designed for those who appreciate a clean borderless interface and maximum focus on content. The application runs completely client-side and does not require connection to any server. All your notes are stored in your browser's `localStorage`.
